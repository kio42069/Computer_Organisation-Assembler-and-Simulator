# Automation

The final assembler is `final_assembler.py`

Errors thrown are 1-indexed while line addresses of labels and variables are 0-indexed

If label is not followed by an instruction, we are ignoring it and not throwing an error

In case a file has multiple errors, we are storing them in a text file in the same directory as the source code named `errors.txt`. It catches all errors in a single line too.

We are printing one of the errors on the terminal

# Float Arithmetic Details

Range of normal numbers - 0.25 to 15.75

Range of denormal numbers - 0.0078125 to 0.2421875

Exponent = 111 is considered infinity and overflow flag is set
