# Automation

We have created our assembler to automatically test for all test files
We have assumed the errorGen test cases are stored in a sub-directory called errorGenTests
We have assumed the simpleBin test cases are stored in a sub-directory called simpleBinTests
We have assumed the hardBin test cases are stored in a sub-directory called hardBinTests

We are creating the output files in the respective folders with the postfix Outputs

The test file name format is test <number>.txt
